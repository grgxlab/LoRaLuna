**LoRaLuna** is a visionary open-source architecture for deploying a decentralized, low-power LoRaWAN-based IoT communication network on the Moon.

This project explores how resilient, asynchronous, and energy-efficient protocols—originally designed for terrestrial sensor networks—can be adapted to support lunar missions such as:

- Robotic mining operations  
- Seismic and environmental monitoring  
- Habitat infrastructure telemetry  
- Emergency fallback communication  
- Rover swarm coordination
